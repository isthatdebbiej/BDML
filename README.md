##BDML Homework 1 

In this homework,  I created a flask app that will generate a random number between 1-6 everything the endpoint \rolldice is called. The code is copied from [Getting Started](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/getting-started/). The goal is to let automatic instrumentation generate telemetry data on our behalf. I haved used the opentelemetry-instrument agent in this homework.
